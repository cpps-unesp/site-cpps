        "resumo": "The objective of this project is to enable an investment in the computational infrastructure of the Institute of Public Policy and International Relations (IPPRI/UNESP). The project proposes the acquisition of equipment with redundancy, high performance (CPU and GPU), and scalable storage capacity. With these resources, it will be possible to expand and open new horizons for collecting, processing, analyzing, and visualizing large volumes of data. Additionally, the project aims to promote collaboration and knowledge exchange among researchers, expanding access and dissemination of digital humanities not only in the State of São Paulo but also in other regions. Our user committee includes representatives from São Paulo (INCT-INEU, UNESP, UNICAMP, UNIFESP), as well as from the University of Brasília (UnB) and the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU). The rationale for this multi-user equipment acquisition request is the advancement of research infrastructure in the humanities, providing greater processing capacity in CPU and GPU, network storage, services, and environments for analyzing and visualizing large databases, allowing for the development of more complex and innovative research. This will broaden the horizons of the field in a context where the humanities face a growing challenge: the volume and complexity of available data. Textual, audiovisual, and social media data proliferate rapidly but are difficult for researchers to process, analyze, and interpret without adequate computational assistance."
